    "# Total Output and Leontief Inverse Calculation Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This script calculates the **total output** (\\( X^0 \\)) and the **Leontief inverse matrices** for input-output analysis. These calculations are widely used in economics to study the interdependencies between sectors of an economy and to determine the total production required to meet a given final demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Script Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Input Matrices\n",
    "The script requires the following inputs:\n",
    "- **`A`**: The original input-output matrix, which represents the interdependencies between sectors.\n",
    "- **`Y`**: The final demand vector, which represents the demand for goods and services in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "These matrices must be stored in the the folder `Input-Output`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Modifications to the Matrices\n",
    "#### Modifications to the `A` Matrix:\n",
    "- The `A` matrix is modified to create a **sanctioned version** (`A_sanctioned`), where certain rows or columns are adjusted to reflect restrictions or sanctions. For example:\n",
    "  - Rows or columns corresponding to specific sectors can be set to zero to simulate restricted trade or production.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifications to the `Y` Matrix:\n",
    "- The `Y` matrix (final demand vector) is modified to create a **sanctioned version** (`Y_sanctioned`), where the demand for goods and services from sanctioned sectors is set to zero. This reflects the impact of sanctions on final demand.\n",
    "- Specifically:\n",
    "  - The script identifies the rows or columns in `Y` that correspond to sanctioned sectors or regions.\n",
    "  - The values in these rows or columns are set to zero to simulate the absence of demand for goods and services from these sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `Y` represents the final demand for goods in different regions, and certain regions are under sanctions, the corresponding entries in `Y` are set to zero to create `Y_sanctioned`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Identity Matrix\n",
    "The script generates an identity matrix `I` of the same size as the input matrix `A`. This is a square matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Leontief Inverse Calculation\n",
    "The Leontief inverse matrix is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "L = (I - A)^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `I` is the identity matrix.\n",
    "- `A` is the input-output matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the sanctioned Leontief inverse matrix is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "L^* = (I - A^*)^{-1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- `A^*` is the sanctioned input-output matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Total Output Calculation\n",
    "The total output \\( X \\) is calculated using the Leontief inverse matrix and the final demand vector \\( Y \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X = L \\cdot Y\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sanctioned scenario, the total output \\( X^* \\) is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X^* = L^* \\cdot Y^*\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Difference in Total Output\n",
    "The difference between the original total output and the sanctioned total output is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "X^0 = X - X^*\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the reduction in total output due to the sanctions or restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Output\n",
    "The script prints the following results to the console:\n",
    "- The Leontief inverse matrices (`L` and `L_sanctioned`).\n",
    "- The total output vectors (`X` and `X_sanctioned`).\n",
    "- The difference in total output (`X^0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes for Classmates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matrix Dimensions**: Ensure that `A` is a square matrix (same number of rows and columns) and that the size of `Y` matches the number of rows in `A`.\n",
    "- **Sanctioned Adjustments**: You can modify `A_sanctioned` and `Y_sanctioned` to reflect specific scenarios, such as setting certain rows or columns to zero to simulate restricted trade or production.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: If you encounter an error about matrix inversion, check that \\( I - A \\) or \\( I - A^* \\) is not singular.\n"
